# VacayPay #

>VacayPay is a tool built with the MEAN stack that helps you split expenses when traveling with friends.

It makes the hassle of sorting out who owes what at the end of a long trip simple and easy. Instead of keeping dozens of transactions in your head, VacayPay gives you peace of mind and lets you focus on your travels.

>Always settle

After you create an account, you can choose to either create a trip or join an existing trip using a friend's secret trip code. Once on a trip, you can create an expense, add a description and location, and select other contributors. If you are traveling in a foreign country, one handy feature is the currency conversion tool that lets you add in expenses using the local currency:
